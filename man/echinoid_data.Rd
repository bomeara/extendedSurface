\title{Comparative dataset used to explore the macroevolution of echinoid body size.}
\format{
A list with all the data to replicate the macroevolutionary analysis
  in Mongiardino Koch & Thompson (2020):
\describe{
  \item{size}{A data.frame including body sizes for all terminals and
  terminal names as row names}
  \item{error}{A named vector with measurement errors, in the same order as \code{$size}}
  \item{tree}{A time-calibrated phylogeny of all taxa with size data}
  \item{fwd_surface}{The result of running \code{surfaceForward} on this dataset}
  \item{bwd_surface}{The result of running \code{surfaceBackward} on this dataset}
}
}
\usage{
echinoid_data
}
\description{
A list containing a data.set of body sizes, a vector of measurement errors, a
time-calibrated phylogeny, and the results of running forward and backward
phases of SURFACE on this dataset.
